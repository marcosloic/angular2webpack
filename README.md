#Angular2 starter with webpack and Firebase

This is my development workflow for Angular2. It borrows heavily from the AngularClass starter kit, altered to suit my needs.

####How to start

- git clone
- npm install
- typings install
- npm start to start the dev environment (Live reload, etc.)
- webpack to build

The files are built in the src/public/scripts folder. The 'public' folder should contain everything needed to deploy your app. Depending on how you choose to add typings, further changes may be necessary.
